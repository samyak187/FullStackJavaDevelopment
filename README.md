# 🚀 Mastering Full Stack Java Development – My Coding Journey to Crack Top Tech Jobs

This repo is my digital journal as I dive deep into the world of Full Stack Java Development. I'm starting from scratch — learning, building, and growing in public with full focus on real-world skills.

📂 What You’ll Find:
🔸 Code snippets, projects & learning notes  
🔸 Real progress as I move from basics to deployment  
🔸 Clear, beginner-first code with thoughtful structure  
🔸 Honest updates & breakthrough moments

🌱 This Is All About:
- Building strong dev habits  
- Learning through doing

- Crafting a job-ready portfolio

💭 My Goal?  
To land a great developer role by building real things, learning every day, and sharing the process.

“Start simple. Stay consistent. Level up.”
